    // 2. Understand the Prototype Chain
    // All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an objectâ€™s prototype itself is an object.
    function Bird(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    typeof Bird.prototype;
    // Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype:
    // Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Bird.prototype);
    // How is this useful? You may recall the hasOwnProperty method from a previous challenge:
    let duck = new Bird("Donald");
    duck.hasOwnProperty("name");
    // hasOwnProperty method is defined in Object.prototype, can be accessed by Bird.prototype, which can then be accessed by duck. 
    // This is an example of the prototype chain. 
    // In this prototype chain, Bird is the supertype for duck, while duck is the subtype. 
    // Object is a supertype for both Bird and duck. 
    // Object is a supertype for all objects in JavaScript. Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty method.
    // Modify the code to show the correct prototype chain.
    function Dog(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
    Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);  // yields true
    // Fix the code below so that it evaluates to true
    if (Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype) == true) {
        console.log('true')
    }
    else { console.log('false') };
}
function question3() {
    // 3. Understand Own Properties
    // In the following example, the Bird constructor defines two properties: name and numLegs:
    function Bird(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.numLegs = 2;
    }
    let duck = new Bird("Donald");
    let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
    // name and numLegs are called own properties, because they are defined directly on the instance object. 
    // In fact every instance of Bird (like duck and canary) will have its own copy of these properties. 
    // The following code adds all of the own properties of duck to the array ownProps:
    let ownProps = [];
    for (let property in duck) {
        if (duck.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
            ownProps.push(property);
        }
    }
    console.log('These are properties of duck: ' + ownProps);
    // The console would display the value ["name", "numLegs"].
    // Add the own properties of canary to the array ownProps.
    let ownProps2 = [];
    // Only change code below this line
    for (let property in canary) {
        if (canary.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
            ownProps2.push(property);
        }
    }
    console.log('These are properties of canary: ' + ownProps2);
}

// 4 Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code
function question4() {
    // Since numLegs will probably have the same value for all instances of Bird, 
    // you essentially have a duplicated variable numLegs inside each Bird instance.
    // This may not be an issue when there are only two instances, but imagine if there are millions of instances. 
    // That would be a lot of duplicated variables. A better way is to use the prototype of Bird. 
    // Properties in the prototype are shared among ALL instances of Bird. 
    // Here's how to add numLegs to the Bird prototype:
    function Bird(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2;
    let duck = new Bird("Donald");
    let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
    // If you add to the prototype, you add to all instances of Bird the numLegs property.
    console.log(duck.numLegs);
    console.log(canary.numLegs);
    // Since all instances automatically have the properties on the prototype, think of a prototype as a "recipe" for creating objects. 
    // Note that the prototype for duck and canary is part of the Bird constructor as Bird.prototype. 
    // Nearly every object in JavaScript has a prototype property which is part of the constructor function that created it.
    // Add a numLegs property to the prototype of Dog
    function Dog(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    // Only change code above this line
    let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
    Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;
    console.log(beagle.numLegs);
}

// 5 Iterate Over All Properties
function question5() {
    // Own properties are defined directly on the object instance itself. And prototype properties are defined on the prototype.
    function Bird(name) {
        this.name = name;  //own property
    }
    Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2; // prototype property
    let duck = new Bird("Donald");
    // Here is how you add duck's own properties to the array ownProps and prototype properties to the array prototypeProps:
    let ownProps = [];
    let prototypeProps = [];
    for (let property in duck) {
        if (duck.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
            ownProps.push(property);
        } else {
            prototypeProps.push(property);
        }
    }
    console.log('These are properties of duck: ' + ownProps); // ["name"] 
    console.log('These are properties of duck: ' + prototypeProps); // ["numLegs"]
    // Add all of the own properties of beagle to the array ownProps. 
    // Add all of the prototype properties of Dog to the array prototypeProps.
    function Dog(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;
    let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
    let ownPropsbeagle = [];
    let prototypePropsbeagle = [];
    // Only change code below this line
    for (let property in beagle) {

// 9  Use Closure to Protect Properties Within an Object from Being Modified Externally
function question9() {
    // In the previous challenge, bird had a public property name. 
    // It is considered public because it can be accessed and changed outside of bird's definition.
    // Therefore, any part of your code can easily change the name of bird to any value. That could cause a lot of issues.
    // The simplest way to make this public property private is by creating a variable within the constructor function. 
    // This changes the scope of that variable to be within the constructor function versus available globally. 
    // This way, the variable can only be accessed and changed by methods also within the constructor function.
    // Here getHatchedEggCount is a privileged method, because it has access to the private variable hatchedEgg. 
    // This is possible because hatchedEgg is declared in the same context as getHatchedEggCount. 
    // In JavaScript, a function always has access to the context in which it was created. This is called closure.
